### Explination of the programming portion:

I have asked you to implement what I am calling an Odd Even queue.
This is a data structure that is very similar to an integer queue, except it has 4 additional methods:
- peekOdd(): returns the next odd element in the queue
- peekEven(): returns the next even element from the queue
- dequeueOdd() returns and dequeues the next odd element from the queue
- dequeueEven() returns and dequeues the next even element from the queue
